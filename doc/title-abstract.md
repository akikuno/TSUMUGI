TSUMUGI: Web tools

# Abstract

TSUMUGI is a web-based platform for the analysis of gene modules using the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) data. TSUMUGI provides a user-friendly interface for the analysis of gene modules that contribute to specific phenotypes. The platform allows users to search for gene modules that are associated with a specific phenotype of interest, and to visualize the relationships between genes and phenotypes. TSUMUGI is a valuable resource for researchers who are interested in the functional analysis of gene modules using in vivo data.
